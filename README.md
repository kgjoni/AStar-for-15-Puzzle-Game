# AStar-for-15-Puzzle-Game
Solution to the 15 Puzzle Game using A-Star with Misplaced Number of Tiles (h1) and Manhattan Distance (h2)

Write a program which performs iterative deepening a-star (IDA*) search to find the
solution to any given board position for 15 puzzle using two types of heuristics:
1. Number of misplaced tiles
2. Manhattan Distance

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_A*

Input
The input should be given in form of a sequence of numbered tiles for initial board configuration,
‘0’ indicating the empty space (see example below)

Output
1. Moves
2. Number of Nodes expanded
3. TIme Taken
4. Memory Used

Rubric

Implement ida* search with heuristic ‘number of misplaced tile’ => 6

Implement ida* search with heuristic ‘manhattan distance’ => 6

Print the moves to reach the solution => 3

Print number of nodes expanded => 2

Print total memory usage => 2

Print total time taken => 2

Coding style, comments, readme instruction => 4
